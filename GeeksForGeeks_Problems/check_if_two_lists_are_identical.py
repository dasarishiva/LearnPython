Method 1 : Using list.sort() and == operator
sort() coupled with == operator can achieve this task. We first sort the list, so that if both the lists are identical,
then they have elements at the same position. But this doesnâ€™t take into account the ordering of elements in list.

"""
Method 2 : Using collections.Counter()
Using Counter(), we usually are able to get frequency of each element in list, checking for it, for both the list,
we can check if two lists are identical or not.
But this method also ignores the ordering of the elements in the list and only takes into account the frequency of elements.
